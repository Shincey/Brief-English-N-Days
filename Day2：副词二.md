## 副词的形式

**以`-ly`结尾的副词**

副词和形容词有很强的联系，它们通常基于同一个单词。副词经常以`形容词+ly`的形式存在。

| 形容词                                | 副词                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| He was calm when I told him.       | He behaved calmly.                  |
| That was a beautiful presentation. | Your work is beautifully presented. |

以`-ly`结尾的一些副词通常是关于方式(manner)和程度(degree)的副词。副词由以`l`结尾的形容词变换而来，需要双写`l`。副词由以`y`结尾的形容词变换而来，需要将`y`改成`i`。副词由以`辅音字母+e`结尾变换来的，保留`e`。

> _beautiful -> beautifuly, careful -> carefully, hopeful -> hopefully_
> 
> _easy -> easily, busy -> busily, lucky -> luckily, angry -> angrily_
> 
> _definite -> definitely, fortunate -> fortunately, extreme -> extremely, absolute -> absolutely_

**以`-ly`结尾的形容词**

一些形容词以`-ly`结尾，如`lively`, `lonely`, `ugly`等， 副词通常不是由它们变换而来，因为不容易发音。通常换一种方式表达。

> _Don't act **in a silly way**._
> 
> _Not: ~~Don't act sillily~~._
> 
> _She said it **in a friendly way**._
> 
> _Not: ~~She said it friendlily~~._

**以`-ward(s)`或`-wise`结尾的副词**

有一小部分副词是以`-ward(s)`或`-wise`结尾的，以`-ward(s)`结尾可以是`-ward`或`-wards`两者形式之一。

> _**-wards**: inwards, eastwards, upwards, downwards_
> 
> _**-wise**: clockwise, lengthwise, likewise_
> 
> _The doctor asked her to move her head **upwards** but she couldn't._
> 
> _Turn the handle **clockwise** to start it._

**和形容词有相同形式的副词**

一些副词和形容词有着相同的形式，比较常见的有`fast (not fastly)`, `left`, `hard`, `outside`, `right`, `straight`, `late`, `well`和一些时间词，如：`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`。

> _This coconut is really **hard**._
> 
> _You have to bang the door **hard** to shut it._

当作为形容词时，通常用来修饰名词，或者跟在`be`, `become`, `seem`, `look`, `smell`, `taste`等这些动词后面。

**和形容词没有联系的副词**

一些副词如`just`, `quite`, `so`, `soon`, `too`, `very`等和形容词没有直接联系。

> _This is **just** what I am looking for. (just = exactly)_
> 
> _These cups are not **quite** the same. (not quite = not exactly)_
> 
> _Why is this road **so** narrow?_
> 
> _I look forward to seeing you **soon**._
> 
> _That's **too** expensive._
> 
> _That's a **very** strange story._

**指明程度的副词**

很多副词和形容词一样，可以表达如质量，特性，状态，条件，关系等等的不同程度。

> _He palys the piano **amazingly**._
> 
> _He palys the piano **really amazingly**. (really程度副词)_
> 
> _She palyed golf **skilfully** this time._
> 
> _She palyed gold **more skilfully** this time. (more程度副词)_
> 
> _She was **quite** surprised they came, **actually**._

| ***            | ***       | ***        | ***      |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| absolutely     | enough    | perfectly  | somewhat |
| a (little) bit | entirely  | pretty     | terribly |
| a lot          | extremely | quite      | too      |
| almost         | fairly    | rather     | totally  |
| awfully        | highly    | remarkably | utterly  |
| completely     | lots      | slightly   | very     |

**指明重点的副词**

> _I **just** wanted to ask you what you thought._
> 
> _I wouldn't **particularly** like to move to a modern house._

| ***        | ***     | ***    | ***          |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| especially | just    | mainly | particularly |
| generally  | largely | only   | simply       |

**指明连接关系的副词**

连接副词指明了两个分句或主句之间的关系，如时间序列、因果关系，两者差异等等：

> _I left my house in the morning **then** I went to pick up Irvine at her house. (时间序列)_
> 
> _We talked until the early hours and **consequently** I overslept the next morning. (因果关系)_
> 
> _The sun will be shining in France. **However**, heavy rain is expected in Spain. (差异)_

通常使用`then`和`consequently`连接分句或句子在一起。`but`和`however`都表示差异，但`but`连接两个分句为一个句子，`however`并非如此：

> _There was no room for them **but** they got on the train._
> 
> _There was no room for them. **However**, the got on the train._

**指明时间关系的副词**
