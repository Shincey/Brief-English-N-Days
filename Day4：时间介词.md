**Notes：** `In + (amount of time)` usually refers to the future. But it can also indicate a length of time.

**注意**：`In + 时间`通常指未来的时间，也可以指一段时间。

- *I will see you __in tow days__ (from now).* --future time.

- *I finished the job __in two days__.* --a length of time.

## by and by the time

We use `by` meaning 'not later than' to refer to arrangements and deadlines:

`by`的‘不要比这个更迟’的意思用来指示一些安排或者截止日期。

- *They said that the plumber would be here __by Monday__.*

- *The postman is always here __by 11 am__.*

We use `by the time`, meaning 'when', to connect an action that has happened or will have happened before a second action. The action that happened second comes after `by the time`.

我们使用`by the time`表达`when`,来连接一个发生过或将要发生的动作在第二个动作前面。第二个工作跟在`by the time`后。

- *__By the time__ you wake up, I'll have finished work.*

- *~~__By the time__ you will wake up ...~~*

- *Unfortunately the man had died __by the time__ the ambulance arrived. (When the ambulance arrived, the man had already died.)*

## since

We use `since` as a preposition with a date, a time or a noun phrase:

`since`作为介词时通常和日期、时间或名词短语搭配：

- _It was the band's first live performance **since** May 1990. (since+date)_

- _I have been happily married for 26 years since the age of 21. (since+noun phrase)_

## ago

`ago` as a adverb usually follows time word(s) and is used to indicate the amount of time before the present:

`ago`作为一个副词跟在时间词后面通常用来指明距离现在时间多久的过去时间：

- *I called her __two weeks ago__.*
- *She returned my call __five minutes ago__.*
