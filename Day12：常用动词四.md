# 常用动词(Like、Look、Marry、Devorce)

### Like

1. 如大家所知，`like`表达我们喜欢或感到积极的事物，后面可以跟名词短语、to动词不定式、ing形式、从句(how、what、where...)等：

   > _Do you **like** pasta?_
   > 
   > _He **likes** telling jokes_
   > 
   > _I don't **like** to cycle in the dark._
   > 
   > _I don't **like** what he did._

   关于`like to do`与`like doing`区别可以参考非限定动词一文。

2. `would like`提供服务和请求：

   > _**would** you **like** a cup of coffee._
   > 
   > _I'**d like** a cheese burger._

3. `like`作为介词意味着`similar to`，经常会和感官动词连用：

   > _My sister is **like** my mother._
   > 
   > _That **looks like** Tom's car._
   > 
   > _He **seems like** a nice man._

   当`like`作为`similar to`的意思时，我们可以在它前面加一些`a bit`、`just`、`very`、`so`、`more`来表达相似的程度：

   > _Isn't that **just like** the bike we bought you for your birthday? (这不就像我们给你买的生日礼物车吗)_
   > 
   > _That **smells very like** garlic._
   > 
   > _The car was **more like** a green than a blue color._

4. 在非正式环境下，`like`作为连词而不是`as`，但传统语法认为这是错的：

   > _**Like** any good cook book will tell you, don't let the milk boil. (也可以是：As any good cook book ...)_

   但`as`和`like`区别还是很明显的，举个例子你就明白了：

   > _As you father, I will help you as much as I can._
   > 
   > _Like your father, I will help you as much as I can._

   可以看出`as + noun`有种`in the role of`的意思，而`like + noun`意味`similar to`/`in the same way as`。

5. 我们可以用`like`作为后缀加到名词后面表达`similar to`：

   > _There is something **child-like** about Marianne. She always seems so innocent._

6. 在口语中，当我们说话突然沉静需要时间来考虑接下来说什么或改变之前说过的措辞，用`like`来填充沉静时间：

   > _I want to ......like...... I think we need to think carefully about it. It's ......like...... it's very difficult desicion for us to make._

   还用`like`引注意力到我们即将要说的，特别是说到数量或时间等：

   > _There were **like** five hundred guests at the wedding. (Like brings focus to the large number of guests.)_
   > 
   > _It wasn't till **like** 12:00 that I actually go to start on the project. (Like bings focus to how late it was.)_

   用`like what`来要求举一个例子：

   > _A: Some really funny things happened on the last day of school._
   > 
   > _B: Funny things? **Like what**?_

   在我们说过的话最后使用`like`表示我们想修改或弱化我们之前说过的，特别是当我们不确定我们说过的是否正确：

   > _A: So, did you buy anything there?_
   > 
   > _B: No. It was too expensive, **like**._
   > 
   > _I hate the film. It was very violent, **like**._

7. `what's ... like?`可以用来寻求一个物体或人的描述(例如他们的外貌，性格，行为)：

   > _**What's** your new apartment **like**?_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~How's your new apartment like~~?_

   `how is ...?`更多的是用来询问某人的一般健康状况，或某事物的状态，或是人们的体验等：

   > _A: **How is** your new car?_
   > 
   > _B: Wonderful. It's so much easier to drive than the old one._

8. `be like`用来谈论某人的性格或个性，`look like`用来谈论某人的外貌：

   > _A: What'**s** your new boss **like**?_
   > 
   > _B: She's nice. She is very professional._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~She is like a very professianl person~~._
   > 
   > _A: What does you father **look like**?_
   > 
   > _B: He is very like me but taller and older._

### Look

1. 我们用`look`来表示“将我们的眼睛转向特定的方向以寻找某些东西”。后面跟`at`来指我们看到的人或事：

   > _He's **looking** at me._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~He's looking me~~._
   > 
   > _Don't **look** now._

   不使用`look`+`if`/`whether`，用`see`：

   > _Can you **see if** there are any biscuits in the cupboard. (你看到柜子里有饼干没)_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~Can you look if there are ...~~_

   `look`用于形成一些短语和介词短语等，如`look after`、`look for`、`look up`等。

2. `look`作为一个连接动词像`appear`、`become`、`seem`一样，不接一个宾语，后面跟一个短语或子句，它提供了有关的更多信息，通常后面还会跟`like`、`as if`、`as though`：

   > _That picture **looks** old._
   > 
   > _That jacket **looks** very expensive._
   > 
   > _It **looks like** a nice day outside._
   > 
   > _She **looks as if** she is going to cry._
   > 
   > _They **looked as though** they had seen a ghost._

3. 在口语中，`look`有时作为话语标记来使用，但需要谨慎使用，当我们需要解释某些事情或提出要点时，我们会使用它，特别是当我们说话特别生气或说话特别有力时：

   > _**Look**, too many people have died in this war._
   > 
   > _**Look**, Mark, you have been late for work every day this week. Is there a reason?_

### Marry / Divorce

1. 通常使用`marry`/`divorce` + 宾语：

   > _Lauren Bacall **married** her co-star, Humphrey Bogart, in 1945 and made three more movies with him._
   > 
   > _He **married** a wealthy widow, but she **divorce** him a year later._

   但是在正式的情况下，也可以不加宾语：

   > _The couple **married** three years ago and have a daughter, Molly._

2. 在非正式环境下，当没有宾语的时候我们使用`get married`/`get divorced`：

   > _Paul and Kaita are **getting married** in Shanghai._
   > 
   > _She finally **got divorced** last year._

3. 我们用`be married`/`be divorced`来描述婚姻的状态：

   > _They **are divorced** now._
   > 
   > _We have **been married** for 50 years._

4. 不在`married`后面跟一个`to`或`with`：

   > _She **married** someone she met at college._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~She married to someone ...~~  /  ~~She married with someone...~~_

5. 我们在`get married`、`be married`后面用`to`而不用`with`：

   > _She **got married to** someone she met at college._
   > 
   > _She **is married to** someone she met at college._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~She got/is married with someone...~~_

6. 我们用`from`跟在`get divorced`/`be divorcd`后面：

   > _She **got divorced from** her second husband._
   > 
   > _She **is divorced from** her second husband._
   > 
   > _She **divorced** her second husband._
