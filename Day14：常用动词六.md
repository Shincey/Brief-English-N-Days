# 常用动词(think、want、wish、need)

### Think

1. 我们使用`think`来讨论有一个观点或主意，这种情况下，我们不用进行时：

   > _I **think** (that) she is a very selfish person._

   > _Not: ~~I am thinking she is ...~~_
   > 
   > _A: What do you **think** aoubt this frame?_
   > 
   > _B: To be honest, I don't **think** it suits the picture._

2. 我们使用`think`来讨论关于制定计划或决定，一般使用进行时，`thinking of/about doing sth`：

   > _We'**re thinking of moving** out of London and buying a small cottage in the country._
   > 
   > _**Thinking about returning** to college? Call 0000 0000 0000 for advice on courses and grants._

3. 我们还可以使用`think / think of`讨论关于`remember`(记得)：

   > 
   > _Can anyone **think of** the name of the first dog that went into space._

4. 我们还可以使用`think about`讨论关于`considering something`(考虑)：

   > _A: Are you going to change jobs?_
   > 
   > _B: I am not sure. I'm **thinking about** it._

5. 在口语中，经常在句子末尾使用`I think`来表达委婉语气：

   > _It's too expensive, **I think**._
   > 
   > _Too many people are talking in the office, **I think**. It's difficult to work at times._

6. `I think`在句首通常表达一种不确定性：

   > _**I think** I gave the file to Holly on Monday._
   > 
   > _**I think** your keys are on the table._

   通常是把否定放在前面：

   > _**I don't think** we have enough people interested in going on the trip. (I think we don't have enough people ...)_

### Want

1. 我们使用`want`谈论`wish`(希望)、`desire`(渴望)，可以直接跟宾语或动词不定式，但是不跟that从句：

   > _Do you **want** drink? I've just made some coffee._
   > 
   > _This is a new kind of fruit juice I got. Do you **want to** try it?_
   > 
   > _The teacher **wants her to** do the exam again next year._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~The teacher wants that she do ...~~_
   > 
   > _Take what you **want**?_

   `want`的进行时表达一种间接性、礼貌性：

   > _I **was wanting** to ask you something. Are you free right now?_

   进行时也可以强调一个正在进行或重复的过程：

   > _we'**d been wanting** to go to Shanghai for years._
   > 
   > _Now that she's a teenager she**'s wanting** expensive things, you know, computers, clothes, sports stuff._

2. 我们可以使用`want` + `doing`来谈论某事需要或应该被做，这是非常不正式的表达：

   > _Your hair **wants cutting**. (needs to be cut)_

3. 非正式场合下，`want` + `to do`可以表达建议或警告：

   > _You **want to** be careful riding your bike in town. (you should be careful)_

### Wish

1. 我们用`wish`+ (`object`) +`to do`表达和`want`一样的意思，但是更正式，这种情况下不用进行时，不使用that从句：

   > _I **wish to** speak to Mr Wang, please._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I am wishing to speak ...~~_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I wish that I speak ...~~_
   > 
   > _I didn't **wish my family to know** about Sara, so I told them nothing._

   当`wish`后面跟宾语时，必须跟`to动词不定式`后面：

   > _We **wish to have a table** near the window, please. (we would like a table near the window)_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~we wish a table near the window ...~~_

2. `wish` + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语 可以用来表达希望好事发生：

   > _I **wish you success** in your new job. (间接宾语：you 直接宾语：success)_
   > 
   > _I've got my driving test tomorrow. **Wish me luck**! (间接宾语：me 直接宾语：luck)_
   > 
   > _We **wish you a long and happy life** together._

3. `wish`+`that 从句`可以表达我们后悔或抱歉事情没有什么不同，我们幻想一个不一样的过去或现在，非正式场合下还可以删除`that`：

   > _I just **wish that** everything could be as it used to be. (我只是希望一切像往常一样)_
   > 
   > _I **wish** I had his mobile phone number; we could tell him the good news. (我没他的手机号，如果有那会很好)_
   > 
   > _I **wish** you hadn't told me how the film ends. (you told me how the film ends. it would have been better if you had not told me.)_

   that从句中动词的时态等和if从句中类似，我们用**过去式表示现在和将来**：

   > _It would be good **if** we **had** a bigger car._
   > 
   > _I **wish** we **had** a bigger car._
   > 
   > _It would be good **if** I **knew** how to use it._
   > 
   > _I **wish** I **knew** how to use it._

   在`wish`用**过去完成时表达过去**

   > _I **wish** I **had known** Charlie was comeing. I would have invited Jane. (I didn't know it and did not invite Jane)_
   > 
   > _I **wish** I **hadn't said** that. I can see I've upset you. Sorry. (I did say it; it would be better if I had not say it.)_

4. 如果我们对某件事(或发生或没有发生或将来发生或将来不发生)恼火，我们可以使用`wish`+`would`：

   > _I **wish** you'**d** stop makeing so much noise! (you are making a noise, it would be better if you didn't)_
   > 
   > _I **wish** you **wouldn't** come through the kitchen with your dirty boots on._

5. 我们使用`hope`而不是`wish`来希望某事发生在将来，或在未来已经发生，其实综合起来，感觉`wish`更多的是表达一种情感，建议，希望啥的：

   > _I **hope** the weather is fine tomorrow._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I wish the weather ...~~_
   > 
   > _I **hope** they didn't miss their flight._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I wish they ...~~_

### Need

1. `need`是一个半情态动词，否定形式常用来表明没有义务或需要做某事：

   > _You **needn't** take off your shoes._

2. 肯定句中使用半情态`need`是比较正式但很少见的，一般句子中会有一个否定词(`no one`/`nobody`/`nothing`)：

   > _No one **need** think that we are doing this every week. (we are not doing this every week)_
   > 
   > Nobody **need** kw the name of the person who made the complaint.
   > 
   > _Not a thing **need** change on this page._

   半情态`need`不和其他情态动词一起使用：

   > _No one **need** read this._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~No one need must read this~~. or ~~No one must need read this~~._

   我们在半情态`need`后加`not`者是 `needn't`，不在前面使用`doesn't / didn't / don't`：

   > _You **need not** spend a lot of money on presents. (or You needn’t spend a lot of money on presents.)_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~You don’t need spend a lot of money on presents~~._

   同样疑问句时也是将半情态动词`need`提前，而不是借助助动词do：

   > _**Need** we write this down?_
   > 
   > Not: ~~Do we need write this down?~~

3. 半情态动词`need`没有一般过去式，作为替代，我们使用`didn't need to / didn't have to`达去没有义务做某事：

   > _I **didn't need to** buy any books. They were all in the library. (其实这里的need不算情态动词)_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I didn’t need buy any books. They were all in the library~~._

   我们使用`needn't have + -ed`形式来指示发生的事，但说话者认为没有必要：

   > _You **needn't have waited** for me. (You waited for me but it wasn’t necessary.)_
   > 
   > _You **needn't have bought** so much food. There are only three of us staying for the weekend. (You bought a lot of food but it wasn’t necessary.)_

4. need为主要动词时后面跟有人称、单复数、时态的变化：

   > _**Does** it **need** **to** be so dark in here?_
   > 
   > _You **don’t** **need** **to** mention this to your father._

   当`need`后面跟名词或`ing形式`时`need`必须作为主动词使用：

   > _You don't **need** an umbrella._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~You needn't an umbrella~~._
   > 
   > _My hair doesn't **need** cutting for at leat another month._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~My hair needn't cutting for ...~~_
