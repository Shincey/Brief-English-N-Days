# 时间连词

`when`, `after`, `before`, `until`, `since`, `while`, `once`, `as`, and `as soon as` are subordinating conjunctions which can be used to connect an action or an event to a point in time.

像`when`, `after`, `before`, `until`, `since`, `while`, `once`, `as`, `as soon as`这样的从属连词通常连接一个动作或者事件表明一个时刻。

| action / event                | conjunction    | time                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| She was in a bad car accident | **when**       | she was young.            |
| We can't play loud music      | **after**      | everyone has gone to bed. |
| Brush your teeth              | **before**     | you go to bed.            |
| I'll wait with you            | **until**      | the bus comes.            |
| I've been very busy           | **since**      | I started my new job.     |
| No one left the cinema        | **while**      | the movie was on.         |
| I'll call you                 | **once**       | I arrive.                 |
| We always have an ice cream   | **as soon as** | we get to the beach.      |
| I bumped into her             | **as**         | I came out of the bank    |

Many of these time conjunctions can be followed by `-ing` or `-ed` forms instead of `subject + verb`.

许多这样的时间连词可以跟随`-ing`或`-ed`形式而不是`主语+动词`

**Warning:** We don't use `will` after conjunctions referring to future time.

**注意：**不可以在连词后面使用`will`来指明未来时间。

- *~~__When__ people will walk in to the room...~~*

- *__When__ people walk into the room, they will feel something special.*

- *~~... __as soon as__ I will get to the office.~~*

- *I will call you __as soon as__ I get to the office.*

## when, once, as, as soon as

We can use `when`, `once`, `as` and `as soon as` to talk about a special point in time when something happened or will happen:

我们可以使用`when`, `once`, `as`,  `as soon as`来说明一个特殊的时刻，当事情发生过了或将要发生。

- *__when__ we were in Greece, we went to as many islands as possible.*

- *They always close their curtains __once__ they get home in the evening.*

- *__As soon as__ we hear any news, we'll call you*

## before, after, until

We use `before` and `after` to talk about the order of events in the past or future. With `before` and `after`, either the main clause or the subordinate clause can come first:

我们可以使用`before`和`after`来说明时间在过去或将来时间中的顺序。使用它们，主句或从句可以放在前面。

- *She'll pick you up __before__ she comes here.*

- *__After__ she comes here, she'll pick you up.*

`Util` as a time conjunction means up to a time in the past or future. In the case of `until`, the main clause usually comes first:

`until`作为一个时间连词指明了过去或将来时间，主句通常放在前面：

- *I am going to wait __until__ the January sales start to buy a new jacket.*

- *__Until__ he mentioned his neme was Doug, I thought he was called Damien.*

## while

We use `while` to show that actions or events happen at the same time in the past, present or future:

`while`用来指明动作或事件发生在过去、现在或将来的相同时间。

- *Can you wait in the car __while__ I run into the shop?*

- *They were talking __while__ the teacher was explaining the activity.*

**Warning:** We don't use `during` instead of `while`. `During` is a preposition, not a conjunction, and it must be followed by a noun or a pronoun:

**注意：**在这里我们不使用`during`, 因为`during`是一个介词，不是连词，它后面必须跟一个名词或者代词。

## since

We use `since` to refer back to a previous point in time. We use `since` as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause:

`since`被用来提及先前的时刻，作为连词的时候用来引出一个从句：

- *It's so long __since__ I saw them. (since+clause)*

- *He's been back to the office a few times __since__ he retired. (since+clause)*

We also use `since` as a preposition with a date, a time or a noun phrase:

`since`作为介词时通常和日期、时间或名词短语搭配：

- *It was the band's first live performance __since__ May 1990. (since+date)*

- *I have been happily married for 26 years since the age of 21. (since+noun phrase)*
