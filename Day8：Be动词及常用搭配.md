**-- be动词做辅助动词：**

1. 英语中的三个助动词包括：`be`、`do`、`have`。我们在进行时和被动语句中使用助动词`be`

   > _I'**m reading** a book at the moment._
   > 
   > _The job **was advertised** last week._
   > 
   > _The house **was being painted**._

    注意：问句中主要动词为一般现在时，使用助动词`do`而非助动词`be`：

   > _**Do** you **live** near here?_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~Are you live near here?~~_

## 常用Be表达式

1. `be about to`常用来表达事情很快就会发生：

   > _I'**m about to** eat. Can I phone you back?_

   经常和`just`搭配使用：

   > _We'**re just about to** set off for a walk. Do you want to come?_

   当是过去时时，它又指事情快发生了但是没有发生：

   > _I **was about to** complain but he came over and apologised._

   不和时间表达搭配使用：

   > _I **was about to** call you._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~I **was about to** call you in ten minutes~~._

2. `be able to` 和 `can`类似，用它来谈论能力。经常放在不能使用`can`的地方，比如在一个情态动词后面：

   > _She **won't be able to** concentrate._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~She **won't can** concentrate.~~_
   > 
   > _He **should be able to** work in a team._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~He **should can** work in a team.~~_

   `be able to`比`can`更正式：

   > _I am very sorry but I **am not able to** give you that information._
   > 
   > _I **cannot** give you that information. (less formal)_

   `was/were able to`在陈述句中通常被用来谈论过去取得的成就成绩等，而不使用`could`。因为这已经是事实，没有可能：

   > _Only one person **was able to** beat the record._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~Only one person could beat the record.~~_

   我们在否定句中使用`couldn't`、`wasn't/weren't able to`：

   > _We **weren't able to** finish the marathon in under four hours._
   > 
   > _We **couldn't** finish ..._

3. `be due to`用来表达未来的动作、事件将可能发生，经常和时间表达连用：

   > _The train **is due to** arrive at 11:00 PM. (The train is expected to arrive at 11:00 PM.)_
   > 
   > _**Are** you **due to** hand in homework today._

4. `be likely to`用来表达一种可能发生的行为：

   > _**Are** parents who have a lot of money **likey to** spoil their children?_

   它经常和`more`、`less`做比较级：

   > _I think men **are more likely to** spend a lot of money on food **than** women are._
   > 
   > _A: I liked Budapest as well._
   > 
   > _B: yeah. I'**m** probably **less likely to** go back there than to Prague._

   还经常使用`it's likely to`或`it's likely that`这种形式：

   > _**It's likely to** rain tomorrow. (It is probably going to rain tomorrow.)_
   > 
   > _**It's likely that** sales will rise._

   在`be likely to`和`be likely that`的否定句中，可以使用`not`或者`unlikely`，后者更正式点：

   > _The company is **not likely to** make a profit in the second half of the year._
   > 
   > _People are **unlikely to** listen to him now because they know he lied._

5. `be meant to`用来表达什么是值得的，期待的或倾向的：

   > _A: It looks green to me._
   > 
   > _B: Oh, **is** it **meant to** be a different color?_
   > 
   > _It **was meant to** be like a quiz and we were all in different teams and there **was meant to** be a fantastic prize._

6. `be supposed to`用来表达义务、约定：

   > _Where were you? You **were supposed to** be at the party._

   它可以表达人们对于某件事的期待或信仰：

   > _A: Take some of this._
   > 
   > _B: What'**s** it **supposed to** do? (What does it do to you?)_
   > 
   > _And then I'm gonna get a train over to Brussels which takes all day as well. It'**s supposed to** be a nice route with forests and mountains and things._

7. `be liable to`用来表达可能遭受风险：

   > _That company **is liable to** go bankrupt if its stocks continue to drop at this rate. (That company runs the risk of going bankrupt if the value of its stocks continues to fall.)_
   > 
   > _Even Susie **is liable to** get fired. (Even Susie runs the risk of being fired.)_

8. `be bound to / be bound for`用来表达不可避免的行为、事件：

   > _She'**s bound to** fail. (She's certain to fail. It's very probably that she will fail.)_
   > 
   > _She **is bound for** stardom. (She is destined to be a star. It's very likely that she will be famous.)_
   > 
   > _He'**s bound to** be upset if you treat him improperly._
   > 
   > _It'**s bound to happen**. (It's inevitably going to happen. It's sure to happen.)_

9. `be sure to`用来表达动作几乎确定要发生，一般现在时带有将来的意思：

   > _Ginobili and Park **are sure to** succeed_.
   >
