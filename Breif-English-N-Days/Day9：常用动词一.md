   > _A: We went to the concert in the park this year._
   > 
   > _B: Yes, we **did** too. (Yes, we went to the concert in the park too.)_

   如果需要替代的是`to动词不定式`，那么不能单独使用`do`替代，可以删除需要替换的动词短语保留`to`，或者使用`do so`、`do it`、`do that`替代：

   > _It's not often I write letters to newspapers, but that day I desperately felt the need (to write letters to newspapers.此括号内容是需要被替代的)_
   >

2. 我们主要用`do so`去指那些主语和动作与我们提到的相同，`do so`比`do it`、`do that`要正式：

   > _I wanted them to leave, and politely asked them **to do so**(asked them to leave), but they wouldn't go, so I call the police._

   使用`do so`要比单独使用`do`正式很多：

   > _Do you mind if I open the present now?_
   > 
   > _Yes, please **do so**. (open the present now)_

   也可以用`do so`替代一系列动作：

   > _The birds make their nests on the north side of the island in little holes in the rocks. The reason why thry **do so** is because ..._

3. 当我们引用涉及动词和宾语时，我们使用`do it`，特别是当主语与我们提到的不一样：

   > _He accidentally deleted some emails on his computer._
   > 
   > _I **do it** all the time. (我一直这么做，两次主语不同)_

4. `do that`强调有意识的动作：

   > _A: Would you ever give a complete stranger your phone number?_
   > 
   > _B: No. I would never **do that**. (I would never give a complete stranger my phone number.)_

   在比较事物的场合也可以使用：

   > _I've decided to wait a year before starting college. I want to travel a bit and see the world._
   > 
   > _B: I really think you should **do that** rather than starting college. You are still so young._

5. `do so`、`do it`、`do that`虽有时有一点差别，但是它们经常可以互换使用

6. 也可以使用情态动词+`do`来替代：

   > _A: I feel terrible._
   > 
   > _B: You should go to the doctor._
   > 
   > _A: I **should do**, I know, but I have so much work to finish._
