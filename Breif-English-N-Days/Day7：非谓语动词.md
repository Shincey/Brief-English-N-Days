# 非谓语动词

每个动词在句子中可以被用作限定动词（谓语动词）或非限定动词（非谓语动词）。限定动词在句中充当谓语，在人称和数上必须和主语保持一致。也就是当一个动词拥有主语和时态时，被称作**限定动词(谓语动词)**：

> _We **want** Irvine to act as club secretary._
> 
> _I **like** taking photographs of insects._
> 
> _Coming home last night, I **saw** a deer run across the road._

**非限定动词(非谓语动词)**不受主语限定，没有人称和数的变化，具有名词、形容词和副词的特征，在句中不能单独充当谓语（但可以和情态动词或助动词一起充当谓语），可以充当主语、宾语、表语、定语、状语、宾语补足语等。常见的形式有`一般形式`、`现在分词形式`、`过去分词形式`和`to动词不定式形式`，当然还有其它形式，如`to动词不定式的进行时(to be teaching)`、`to动词不定式的完成时(to have taught)`和`to动词不定式的被动形式(to be taught)`等：

> _**To open**, tear off the tab._
> 
> _**Looking** around, he noticed a letter on the floor._
> 
> _**Worn out** by the heat, they stopped for a drink._
> 
> _**That plan failling**, he gave up._

## 一般形式

动词的非限定部分的一般形式有以下几种用法：

-- **在情态动词后面：**

> _You must **stop** at the kerb before you cross._
> 
> _He should think before he speaks._

-- **在`let's(suggestion)`、`let(permission)`、`make(compulsion)`后面：**

> _**Let's invite** Annette round for dinner._
> 
> _**Let** the cat **go**!_
> 
> _**Make** him **stop**!_
> 
> _**Let** him **finish** what he was saying!_

-- **在`feel`、`hear`、`see`、`watch` `+` `对象`后：**

> _I **heard him run** downstairs._
> 
> _Later we **saw them leave** the house._

-- **在`动词不定式`连接的`and`后：**

> _I want you to sit and **listen**._
> 
> _Just wait and **see**._

-- **在`would rather`和`had better`后：**

> _I would rather **go** out, but I think we had better **stay** home and finish the painting._

感官动词(`see`、`hear`、`feel`、`smell`、`listen to`、`watch`)可以跟一般形式或`ing`形式，但两者意思有一些不同：

> _We watched her **park** the car. (目睹了事件的整个过程)_
> 
> _We watched her **parking** the car. (可能只目睹了事件的一部分)_
> 
> _I heard a bird call. (我听见只有一只鸟叫)_
> 
> _I heard the birds **singing**._ (我听见了很多鸟唱的歌的一部分)

2. `ing形式`有如下用法：

-- **一些动词通常只能跟`ing形式`：**

| ------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| admit         | deny      | finish    | mind     |

-- **动词(`like、love、hate、prefer`)后加`ing形式`或`to动词不定式`都可以，并且意思没有太大区别，`ing形式`注重动词本身，`to动词不定式`注重行为的偏好或结果：**

> _She **likes to swim** in the sea. (注重表达偏好)_
> 
> _She **likes swimming** in the sea. (注重表达游泳过程)_

-- **动词(`like`、`love`、`hate`、`prefer`)在和`would/should`连用时，只有`to动词不定式`没有`ing形式`：**

> _She **would love to get** a job nearer home._
>
