# 时间副词

Adverbs of time tell us **when** an action happened, but also **for how long**, and **how often**. They are extremely common in English. Adverbs of time have standard positions in a sentence depending on what the adverb of time telling us. These  simple rules for adverbs of time will help you to use the the right way.

时间副词用于表达事情**什么时候发生**，**发生多久**， **发生的频率**。它们在英语中是极其常见的，并且根据表达的内容来放置其在句子中的位置。下面几个规则帮助你正确使用它们。

## Adverbs that tell us when 关于when的时间副词

Adverbs of time often work best with when placed at the end of sentence.

关于`when`的时间副词通常放在句子末尾。

- *I went to the park __yesterday__.*

- *I saw Tomas __today__.*

- *I'm going to tidy my room __tomorrow__.*

- *I will call you __later__.*

- *I saw the movie __last year__.*

- *I called you __five minutes ago__.*

All adverbs that tell us when can be placed at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize the time element. Some can also be put before the main verb in formal writing, while others cannot occupy that position.

所有关于`when`的时间副词都可以放到句首用以强调。在一些正规写作中，有一些也可以放到主要动词前面，但不是全部。

- *__Later__ Irvine ate some cakes. (the time is important)*

- *Irvine __later__ ate some cakes. (this is more formal, like a policeman's report)*

- *Irvine ate some cakes __later__. (this is neutral, no particular emphasis)*

## Adverbs that tell us for how long 关于how long的时间副词

Adverbs of time describing for how long an action occurred usually work best at the end of a sentence.

关于`how long`的时间副词通常也是放在句子末尾。

- *she stayed at her grandmother's house __all day__.*

- *My father was up with heartburn __for hours__.*

- *I have been going this school __since 1996__.*

In these adverbial phrases that tell us for how long, `for` is always followed by an expression of duration, while `since` is always followed by an expression of a point in time.

在这些关于`how long`的句子当中，`for`经常放在一段时间前面，而`since`经常放在一个时间点前面。

- *I stayed in Shanghai __for three days__.*

- *The French monarchy lasted __for several centuries__.*

- *I haven't seen you __since Friday__.*

- *Irvine has been working here __sice 2008__.*

## Adverbs that tell us how often 关于how often的时间副词

Adverbs that tell us how often express the frequency of an action. They are usually placed before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs (such as `be`, `have`, `may`, `must`). The only exception is when the main verb is `to be`, in which case the adverb goes after the main verb.

关于`how often`的副词经常放在主要动词前面一些辅助动词后面（如`be`, `have`, `may`, `must`）。唯一的例外是当主要动词是`to be`的时候，副词跟在主要动词后面。

- *I __often__ eat vegetarian food.*

- *He __never__ drinks milk.*

- *You must __always__ fasten your seat belt.*

- *I am __seldom__ late.*

- *He __rarely__ lies.*

Many adverbs that express frequency can also be placed at either the beginning or the end of the sentence, although some cannot be. When they are placed in these alternate positions, the meaning of the adverb is much stronger.

一些表达频率的副词可以放在句子的开头或者结尾，虽然有些不可以。当它们被放在这些交替的位置时，副词的意思是非常强烈的。

| Adverb that can be used in two positions | Stronger position                        | Weaker positon                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| frequently                               | I visit England __frequently__.          | I __frequently__ visit England.          |
| generally                                | __Generally__, I don't like spicy food.  | I __generally__ don't like spicy foods.  |
| normally                                 | I listen to music __normally__.          | I __normally__ listen to music.          |
| occasionally                             | I go to the opera __occasionally__.      | I __occasionally__ go to the opera.      |
| often                                    | __Often__, I jog in the morning.         | I __often__ jog in the morning.          |
| regularly                                | I come to this museum __regularly__.     | I __regularly__ come to this museum.     |
| sometimes                                | I get up very early __sometimes__.       | I __sometimes__ get up very early.       |
| usually                                  | I enjoy being with children __usually__. | I __usually__ enjoy being with children. |

Some other adverbs that tell us how often express the exact number of times an action happens or happened. These adverbs are usually placed at the end of the sentence.

一些表达确切次数的副词，通常放在句子末尾。

- *I play basketball __monthly__.*

- *I play basketball __once a week__.*

- *I play basketball __five days a week__.*

- *I played basketball __seven times__.*

## Order of adverbs of time 时间副词的顺序

If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in this order:

如果你在一个句子中使用超过一个时间副词，按照下面的顺序：

**1.how long  2.how often  3.when**

- *She volunteered at the hospital (1) for three days (2) every month (3) last year.*

## Using yet 使用yet

`Yet` is used in questions and in negative sentences to indicate that something that has not happened or may not have happened but is expected to happen. It is placed at the end of the sentence or after `not`.

`Yet`被用在问句或否定句中去指明一些没有发生或者可能没有发生但希望发生的事。放置在句子末尾或者`not`的后面。

- *Have you finished you homework __yet__?*

- *No, not __yet__.*

- *They haven't met him __yet__.*

- *Haven't you finished __yet__?*

## Using still 使用still

`Still` expresses continuiry. In positive sentences it is placed before the main verb and after auxiliary verbs such as `be`, `have`, `might`, `will`. If the main verb is `to be`, then place still after it rather than before. In questions, `still` goes before the main verb.

`still`表达连续性。在肯定句中它被放置在主要动词前面辅助动词后面，诸如：`be`, `have`, `might`, `will`. 如果主要动词是`to be`，就放置在它的后面。 在问句当中，`still`放置在主要动词前面。
