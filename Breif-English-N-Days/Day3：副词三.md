## 常见的副词

### even

通常使用`even`来指一些意想不到的，出乎意料额，不寻常的或极端的事情：

> _He didn't **even** have enough money to pay the rent._
> 
> _You love me, **even** after the terrible things I've done?_

**even的位置**

当`even`指代整个分句或句子的时候，通常把`even`放到中间位置（主语和主动词之间、情态动词后面、第一个助动词后面、be主动词后面）

> _You can take an online course now and you **even** do the test online._
> 
> _I haven't **even** started making dinner._

_There's **even** a dog._

也可以把`even`或`not even`放到分句或句子中我们需要强调的部分的前面：

> _**Even** a five-year-old can see that these figures don't add up._
> 
> _They came in cars, in lorries, and **even** an aeroplane._
> 
> _It's not usually too busy. **Not even** at weekends._

有时在不正式的说话中，会把`even`放到分句句子末尾。

**even和比较级**

`even`和比较级组合强调：

> _Since then they have become **even** bigger and richer, and their concerts **even** more popular._

**even和also**

两者都是副词，`even`用来增加一件意想不到或出乎意料的事的强调效果或更多信息，`also`用来增加一些新的信息，但没有强调这是意想不到或出乎意料的效果：

> _Human beings, we are told, will live for 150, **even** 200 years, by the end of the century._
> 
> _She was a very beautiful girl. She was **also** very bright and excelled at everything she did._

**even though和even if**

`even though`的意思和`although`一样，通常拿来说明一些事不是我们期待的。`even though`比`although`更有强调性：

> _I think they're fantastic, **even though** they haven't won any games this season._

`even if`通常用来指明一些可能发生的意料之外的或极端的事件：

> _I'm still going to swimming in the sea **even if** it rains. (I don't expect rain but it is possible.)_
> 
> _I've got to get home **even if** it means flying the plane myself. (I've got to get home and I'll do anything to get there.)_

**even so**

`even so`意味着尽管如此，和`however`，`nevertheless`有着相似的意思。通常在分句的前面位置，但也可以在末尾位置。经常在`but`后面。

> _Their holiday went well but, **even so**, they longed to be home again with the children._
> 
> _You do need your seatbelt on. Put it on please. I know it's not very far, but **even so**. If we have an accident you'll need it._
> 
> _I know you don't like her, but you should say hello to her **even so**._

### Eventually

通常指“最后地”，特别是当一件事需要很长的时间、很多的努力或有很多的问题：

> _I looked everywhere for my keys, and **eventually** found them inside one of my shoes! (I found them after a long time and a lot of effort.)_

**注意**：`eventually`没有`perhaps / possibly / if possible`的意思。其实记住`eventually`表示一件事需要时间、或很多努力等就好。

> _I asked the receptionist to change my room and give me a bigger one, and **if possible**, away from the traffic noise._
> 
> _Not: ~~... and, **eventually**, away from the traffic noise~~ ._

我们使用`finally`或`lastly`，而不是`eventually`来指示一系列东西的最后一项：

> _**Finally**, I think that the best way of facing and dealing with situations like these, is , as I have mentioned, to be diplomatic, nice, patient, sensible and to show respect._
> 
> _Not: ~~**Eventually**, I think that the ...~~_

### Hardly

`Hardly`是一个有否定意思的副词。通常表示`almost not at all`或`only just`。可以放在中间位置，或在一个形容词或名词前面：

> _He wore a big hat that covered his head and you could **hardly** see his face. (you could only see a small part of his face)_
> 
> _It's **hardly** surprising that Leeds, England's third largest city, is now fast becoming a very popular UK holiday destination._
> 
> _At first **hardly** a person in the audience moved, although some umbrellas were opened. But then the rain came down more heavily._

**hardly any, hardly ever**

经常把`hardly`放在`any`, `anyone`, `anybody`, `anything` 和 `ever`前，但不放在`no`, `none`, `no one`, `nobody`, `nothing`或`never`前面：

> _At first, **hardly** anyone came. (almost no one came)_
> 
> _Not: ~~At first **hardly** no one came.~~_
> 
> _There was **hardly** anything to eat._
> 
> _She lives in Scotland so we **hardly** ever see her now, but I like to keep in touch._

**hardly at all**

有时会把`at all`放在动词、形容词、名词后面，并且它在`hardly`的后面的位置，来起到强调效果：

> _I **hardly** slept **at all** last night._

**hardly and very little, very few**

`hardly + any(thing)`意思类似与`very little`或`very few`：

> _I **hardly** ate **anything** yesterday. (= I ate very little yesterday.)_
> 
> _She **hardly** buys **any** new clothes at all. (= She buys very few new clothes.)_

在一些正规表达中，要表明一些事立即发生在其他事后面，使用`hardly...when`。并把`hardly`放在前面位置，倒置主语和动词：

> _**Hardly** had I arrived there **when** I was called back to the head office 100 miles away. (I arrived there and then I was immediately call back.)_

### Hopefully

`hopefully`副词的意思是`wanting the answer to be yes`：

> _Their father said they were not allowed to have a puppy until they were older but we saw them sitting **hopefully** outside the pet shop._
> 
> _'Could you lend me $20?' he asked **hopefully**._

通常把`hopefully`放在前面位置来说明我们希望或愿意等。有时也别用作一个答案去回复：

> _**Hopefully**, the economic problems in the country will not get any worse._
> 
> _A: Wil they win the match tonight?  B: **Hopefully**._

### Largely

`Largely`表示`almost completely`，几乎全部地、多半地：

> _The downturn in the economy in the 1970s was **largely** due to oil prices._

**注意：**`largely`没有`enormously(极其地，非常)`, `greatly(非常)` 或 `significantly(显著地)`这些意思：

> _Traffic flows in the city centre have been **greatly** improved by the opening of the new ring road._
> 
> _Not: ~~...have been **largely** improved...~~_

不使用`largely`表示`widely(范围广阔地)`或`by many people`：

> _This issue has been **widely** debated in recent years._
> 
> _Not: ~~... has been **largely** debated...~~_

### Likely and unlikely

`likely`和`unlikely`是**形容词**，通常用来表达未来的某件事可能会发生或不会发生，可以放在名词前面，或和`be动词`, `seem`, `appear`在一起：

> _What is the most **likely** outcome of the referendum?_
> 
> _It seems **unlikely** that inflation will fall below 3% this year._

我们可以在`likely`或`unlikely`后面跟一个动词不定式：

> _The economy is **likely** to recover slowly after the long recession._
> 
> _Are you **likely** to want this cardboard box or shall I throw it out?_
> 
> _The weather seems **unlikely** to change over the next few days._

我们同样可以说`not likely`, 而不是`unlikely`：

> _Irvine's **not likely** to arrive before eight o'clock. She doesn't finish work till seven._

也可以在`likely`和`unlikely`后面跟带`will`的`that从句`。这种形式和加动词不定式比，不怎么常见：

> _It is **likely** that there will be a general election next year. (There is likely to be a general election next year.)_

我们可以使用像`very`/`quite`/`highly`/`extremely`等副词和`likely / unlikely`组合来增强他们的意思：

> _The government is **very likely** to propose changes to the income tax system soon._

我们可以使用`likely / unlikely`和`as ... as`, `more`, `(the) most`, `less`, `(the) least`来比较事物之间的可能和不同：

> _Steve is **as likely** to get the job **as** Dora. They're both very well qualified._
> 
> _People are **more likely** to take climate change seriously if they can understand the economic consequences for their own lives._
> 
> _Kevin is **(the) least likely** to want to get married of all his friends._

`likely`是有副词意思的，和`probably`类似，经常出现在`will`和一个主动词之间：

> _The new regulations **will likely** result in many people losing their jobs._

**注意：**`It's likely to`不等同于`It's easy to`：

> _**It's easy to** forget to save your work on the computer._
> 
> _Not: ~~**It's likely to** forget ...~~_

### Surely

我们使用`surely`表达一种确定的程度。它不像`definitely`或`certainly`那么确定，当我们使用`surely`时我们希望听我们说话的人能够同意我们的观点：

> _Lisa will **surely** find a solution to the problem. (I want you to agree with me that Lisa will find a solution.)_
> 
> _**Surely** this is against the law. (I want you to agree with me that it is against the law.)_

`surely`和`certainly`比较：

> _It's **surely** quicker if you have a computer. (I think that it is quicker if you have a computer and I want you to agree.)_
> 
> _It's **certainly** quicker if you have a computer. (I am certain that it is quicker if you have a computer.)_

在否定句中，`surely`有表达意想不到，吃惊的意思：

> _**Surely** you're not going to take two weeks off work? (I am surprised that you're going to take two weeks off.)_
> 
> _**Surely** she's not interested in a job like that? (I am surprised that she is interested in a job like that.)_

### Too

**`too`意味着`more than enough`时**

`too + 形容词或副词`:

> _This coffee is **too** sweet._
> 
> _Not: ~~This coffee is **too much** sweet.~~_
> 
> _I can't sleep. It's **too** hot._
> 
> _It happened **too** quickly, so I just didn't see it._

`too + 形容词或副词 + 动词不定式`：

> _The water was **too cold to swim** in._
> 
> _Two hours is **too long to wait**._

当我们谈论数量时，用`too much` / `too many` / `too few` / `too little` + 名词：

> _There's **too much** salt in this soup. (too much + 不可数名词)_
> 
> _There were **too many** dogs on the beach. (too many + 可数名词)_
> 
> _I don't like this book because there are **too few** pictures in it. (too few + 可数名词)_
> 
> _The trip was cancelled because there was **too little** interest in it. (too little + 不可数名词)_

我们可以使用`much / far + too`来强调，`far too`更强烈些。

`too/very`+形容词或副词强调时，意思不太一样：

> _She is **very** careful. (very makes careful stronger.)_
> 
> _She is **too** careful. (too careful meas 'more careful than is necessary'.)_

我们应该使用`very much`而不是`too much`来强调一些例如`like`, `dislike`, `hope`, `doubt`等一些动词：

> _I like it **very much** because I got it from my husband._
> 
> _Not: ~~I like it **too much**...~~_
> 
> _I doubt **very much** that Ronan will be able to come to the party._
> 
> _Not: ~~I doubt **too much** that ...~~_

在口语中，我们可以使用`too bad`或`that's too bad`来表示听到某件事感到不好等，特别在美式口语中：

> _A: The weather forecast says it's going to rain again on Wednesday._
> 
> _B: **Too bad**. We were planning to go for a picnic._
> 
> _A: How's your mother?_
> 
> _B: She's okay but she's felling lonely because she lives on her own now._
> 
> _A: **That's too bad**. Does she have many friends living nearby?_

**`too`意味着`also`时**

在非正式情况下，我们通常在句子结尾使用`too`来表示也：

> _A: I think I'll have the soup._
> 
> _B: I'll have that **too**._

在非正式简短的回答时，我们使用`me too`，而不是`I too`：

> _A: I love that color._
> 
> _B: **Me too**._

在很正式场合情况下，我们使用`too`紧跟主语：

> _You **too** could have a week in the sun._

### Ultimately

`ultimately`用来表示最终地：

> _**Ultimately**, I'd like to go to university, but before that I wnat to get some work experience and travel a bit._
> 
> _We came to the conclusion **ultimately** that political demonstratinos were a waste of time._

`ultimately`没有`recently`的意思：

> _**Recently**, the price of shares in the company has dropped._
> 
> _Not: ~~**Ultimately**, the price of shares ...~~_
