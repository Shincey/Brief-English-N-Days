# 常用动词(Matter、Mean、Miss)

### Matter

**-- matter作为动词**

1. `It doesn't matter`是非常常用的，它意味着`it's not important`、`I don't mind`、`it's not a problem`等：

   > _A: I forgot to buy milk when I was in town._
   > 
   > _B: **It doesn't matter**. We've got enough till tomorrow._
   > 
   > _**It doesn't matter** if you can't be here by nine o'clock. We can start without you and you can join us later._

2. 我们还可以经常使用`matter`提问，常跟一个`if从句`，这常意味着`Is it a problem?`：

   > _**Does it matter** if I leave my computer on all night?_
   > 
   > _**Would it matter** which fight we got?_
   > 
   > _A: I forgot to compy Chris in on the email to Margaret._
   > 
   > _B: **Does it matter**?_
   > 
   > _A: I suppose not._

3. 我们也可以在肯定句中使用`matter`来表达某事对某人很重要，经常跟`to`，这不常见：

   > _A: Sally says the school buildings are in a bad state._
   > 
   > _B: Well, the local authority doesn't care. Nobody cares._
   > 
   > _A: Well **it matters to Sally**. She has to work there. **It matters to me** that my children should be polite to adults._

**-- matter作为名词**

1. `what's the matter (with)`用来询问某人有什么问题吗或询问状况或寻求一个看似有问题的情况的解释等：

   > _**What's the matter**, darling? Why are you crying?_
   > 
   > _**What's the matter with** Derek these days? He's acting so strangely._

   我们不说`the matter is ...`，我们说`the problem is ...`：

   > _He'd like to live in the USA. **The problem is** he can't get a visa._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~The matter is ...~~_

   当我们回答`what's the matter`时，不使用`matter`而使用`problem`，如上。

2. `matter`作为可数名词时，意味着`question`、`problem`、`issue`：

   > _This is a **matter** for the police. We cannot deal with it ourselves._
   > 
   > _Are there any other **matters** to discuss today, or shall we finish?_

   `matter`作为不可数名词时，意味着构成宇宙的物质：

   > _How much **matter** is there in the entire universe? Scientists are not absolutely sure._

3. `as a matter of fact`用来强调某事物和我们之前说过的、人们考虑期待的不一样：

   > _A: I don't think you like Hilary, don't you?_
   > 
   > _B: No, that's just not true. **As a matter of fact**, I'm very fond of her. It's just that she irritates me sometimes._

4. `in a matter of` + `time expression`常用来指代某事物发生很快，或很快被完成：

   > _It's used to take an hour to get to the airport, but now with the new metro line you can get there **in a matter of minutes**. (过去需要一个小时才能到达机场，但现在有了新的地铁线，你可以在几分钟内到达)_

5. `no matter`可以作为连词连接两个分句，它是`it doesn't matter`的简短形式，可以跟`what`/`when`/`where`/`which`/`who`/`how`来指即使我们尝试也无法改变的情况：

   > _**No matter what** I wear, I always feel dull and old-fashioned._
   > 
   > _**No matter where** she looked, she could not find the missing paper._
   > 
   > _He never answers emails, **no matter how** many you send him._

   只有一个分句，我们用`it doesn't matter` + `what`/`when`/`where`/`which`/`who`/`how`，而不是`no matter`：

   > _A: There are three phone numbers here for the tax office. Which one do I call?_
   > 
   > _B: **It doesn't matter** which one you use._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~No matter which one you use~~._

   同样的，`it doesn't matter` + `if从句` 而不是`no matter`：

   > _**It doesn't matter if** you wear a smart suit, they still won't let you in without a tie._

### Mean

1. 解释或询问一个单词或短语意思等：

   > _What does 'strike' mean?_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~What means 'strike'~~?_

   当我们谈论表达想法时，我们通常不会使用进行时：

   > _What does that sign mean?_
   > 
   > _Not: ~~What is that sign mean~~?_

2. 我们使用`mean`来澄清我们所说的内容或解释我们想要说的内容：

   > _You have to take the road by the church._
   > 
   > _Which church?_
   > 
   > _Here's what I **mean**, Lynn: there are roads ahead. Take the right-hand road._

   在`mean`后面加`to动词不定式`来表达意图：

   > _Sorry, I didn't **mean to upset** you._
   > 
   > _I **mean to call** you before I left. I forgot._

   通常用`keep meaning to`来表达长期的意图：

   > _I'll have to catch the 7 am train to Shanghai, which **means getting** up at 5 am. (I need to get up at 5 am.)_

   我们也会用`be meant to`表达责任义务，与`be supposed to`(应该)相似，具体参考前文关于`be`动词的介绍：

   > _Why are you watching TV? You **are meant to** be working._

6. 我们用`mean by`来询问某人在使用一个单词或短语时想到的特定内容：

   > _We don't want to discourage her from studying._
   > 
   > _It depends what you **mean by** 'discourage'._
   > 
   > _Well, I mean make her think we can't afford to pay for her._

7. `means`作为一个名词，虽然以`s`结尾，但却是单数名词，我们可以用它来谈论做某事的方法：

   > _The most economical **means** of travelling to Aberdeen is by plane._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~... to Aberdeen are by plane.~~_

8. `I mean`是非常常用的话语标记，当我们想要补充我们刚说过的内容时，我们会使用它，以便更清楚的说明或纠正我们说过的内容：

   > _The law is not fair. **I mean**, it is just not right that he didn't go to prison. (补充)_
   > 
   > _It cost over 200. **I mean**, that's more than most of us can afford. (清楚的说明)_
   >

   > 
   > _I think Peter probably has a strong view about that. It's interesting ... **I mean** I ... what I said earlier and **I mean** Perter might disagree with me._

   当我们不确定说什么时，可以用`I mean`，经常在它前面或后面停顿：

   > _She's not coming back, er **I mean**, erm ... she and I have broken up._

   我们不用`I mean`来讨论我们的意见，这和`I think`有所区别：

   > _**I think** we should stay at the Lakeside Inn._
   > 
   > _Not: ~~**I mean** we should stay at ...~~_

9. 在口语中，我们经常使用`you know what I mean`(或`if you know what I mean`/`do you know what I mean`)短语来确认我们的听众是否理解我们的意思，或者我们认为听众和我们有相同的意见：

   > _A: I just can't go to Norah's house._
   > 
   > _B: Why's that?_
   > 
   > _A: I just don't like all the cats. **You know what I mean?** They're everywhere even in the beds._
   > 
   > _B: Yeah, I have to say I'm not a fan of cats either._

   > _Not: ~~I losed the bus~~._

   当我们表达我们没有足够的我们需要或想要的东西时，我们会用`lack`而不是`miss`：
